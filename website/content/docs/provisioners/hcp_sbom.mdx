# `hcp-sbom` provisioner reference

The `hcp-sbom` provisioner uploads software bill of materials (SBOM) files from artifacts built by Packer to HCP Packer. You must format  SBOM files you want to upload as JSON and follow either the [SPDX](https://spdx.github.io/spdx-spec/latest) or [CycloneDX](https://cyclonedx.org/) specification. HCP Packer links these SBOM files to the version of the artifact that Packer builds.

## Example

The following example uploads an SBOM from the local `/tmp` directory and stores a copy in the `/sboms-catalog` directory on the local machine:

```hcl
provisioner "hcp-sbom" {
    source = "/tmp/sbom_cyclonedx.json"
    sbom_name = "my_sbom"
    destination = "./sbom_cyclonedx.json"
}
```

## Configuration reference

You can specify the following configuration options.

Required parameters:

- `source` (string) - The path to the SBOM file in the Packer artifact. This file must either be in the SPDX or CycloneDX format.

Optional parameters:

- `sbom_name` (string) - The name of the SBOM file stored in HCP Packer. If omitted, HCP Packer uses the build fingerprint as the file name. This value must be between three and 36 characters from the following set: `[A-Za-z0-9_-]`.

- `destination` (string) - The path on the local machine to store a copy of the SBOM file. You can specify an absolute or a path relative to the working directory when you execute the Packer build.
